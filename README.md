# NLP

Repository for CS 4395 (Human Language Technologies) course

## Overview of NLP

This is a brief overview of NLP and why I am taking the course.

You can see the document [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW0/Overview_of_NLP.pdf).

## Employee Data Sanitizer

This is a Python program that reads employee data written in an inconsistent format and outputs the data in a consistent format.

You can see the source code [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW1/hw1.py).

You can see an overview of the assignment [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW1/HW1_Overview.pdf).

## NLTK Basics Python Notebook

This is a Python notebook going over the basics of using NLTK.

You can see the notebook [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW2/hw2.ipynb).

You can see the pdf of the notebook [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW2/hw2.pdf).

## NLTK Word Game

This is a Python program that explores more NLTK functions, specifically the POS tagging function. It also contains a word guessing game that uses words that NLTK picks out from a piece of text. The program finds the 50 most common nouns in the text and uses those words as the guessing game's dictionary.

You can see the source code [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW3/hw3.py).

## NLTK WordNet Python Notebook

This is a Python notebook exploring the basics of using WordNet and SentiWordNet in NLTK.

You can see the notebook [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW4/hw4.ipynb).

You can see the pdf of the notebook [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW4/hw4.pdf).

## NLTK Ngrams

This is a pair of Python programs that use NLTK's ngrams module to build a probabilistic model for English, French, and Italian. These models are then used to predict the language of various lines of text in a test dataset.

You can see the program that creates the models [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW5/program1.py).

You can see the program that uses the model to predict on test data [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW5/program2.pdf).

You can see the data [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW5/data). You must run the programs from the same directory as the data.

You can see a narrative document discussing ngrams [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW5/Narrative.pdf).
