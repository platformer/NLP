## NLTK Basics Python Notebook

This is a Python notebook going over the basics of using NLTK.

## NLTK Word Game

This is a Python program that explores more NLTK functions, specifically the POS tagging function. It also contains a word guessing game that uses words that NLTK picks out from a piece of text. The program finds the 50 most common nouns in the text and uses those words as the guessing game's dictionary.

You can see the source code [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW3/hw3.py).
