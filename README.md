# NLP

Repository for CS 4395 (Human Language Technologies) course

## Overview of NLP

This is a brief overview of NLP and why I am taking the course.

You can see the document [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW0/Overview_of_NLP.pdf).

## Employee Data Sanitizer

This is a Python program that reads employee data written in an inconsistent format and outputs the data in a consistent format.

You can see the source code [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW1/hw1.py).

You can see an overview of the assignment [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW1/HW1_Overview.pdf).

## NLTK Basics Python Notebook

This is a Python notebook going over the basics of using NLTK.

You can see the notebook [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW2/hw2.ipynb).

You can see the pdf of the notebook [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW2/hw2.pdf).

## NLTK Word Game

This is a Python program that explores more NLTK functions, specifically the POS tagging function. It also contains a word guessing game that uses words that NLTK picks out from a piece of text. The program finds the 50 most common nouns in the text and uses those words as the guessing game's dictionary.

You can see the source code [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW3/hw3.py).

You can get a sample text document [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW3/anat19.txt).

## NLTK WordNet Python Notebook

This is a Python notebook exploring the basics of using WordNet and SentiWordNet in NLTK.

You can see the notebook [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW4/hw4.ipynb).

You can see the pdf of the notebook [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW4/hw4.pdf).

## NLTK Ngrams

This is a pair of Python programs that use NLTK's ngrams module to build a probabilistic model for English, French, and Italian. These models are then used to predict the language of various lines of text in a test dataset.

You can see the program that creates the models [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW5/program1.py).

You can see the program that uses the model to predict on test data [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW5/program2.pdf).

You can see the data [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW5/data). You must run the programs from the same directory as the data.

You can see a narrative document discussing ngrams [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW5/Narrative.pdf).

## Webcrawler

This is a Python program that takes a starting url and recursively crawls linked webpages, scrapes their text, and outputs a list of important terms among all the scraped pages. Some simple measures are taken to prevent the program from scraping irrelevant links or staying within the same domain. I chose to start the program with a link to a wikipedia page about the 2022 season of Formula 1. I used the BeautifulSoup package to perform the webscraping.

You can see the source code [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW6/hw6.py).

You can see an overview document [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW6/HW6_Overview.pdf).

## Syntax Parsing

This is a document demonstrating a PSG, dependency, and SRL parse of a somewhat complex sentence.

You can see the document [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW7/hw7.pdf).

## Author Attribution

This is a python notebook exploring the basics of sklearn and neural networks in order to identify the authors of the Federalist papers.

You can see the notebook [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW8/hw8.ipynb).

You can see a pdf the above notebook [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW8/hw8.pdf).

You can see the dataset [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW8/federalist.csv).

## Chatbot

This is a chatbot written in Python. The chatbot primarily functions by drawing from Reddit comments on subreddits associated with the user's interests, but it will fall back on hard-coded canned responses when no good data seems available.

You can see the source code [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW9/chatbot.py).

You can access a Google Colab notebook of the chatbot [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JoAQF8m72Gm78dE8HQVkZePeKSYPPXTy?usp=sharing).

You can see a README of the chatbot [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW9/README.md).

You can see a written report on the chatbot [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW9/Chatbot_Report.pdf).

## ACL Paper Summary

This is a summary of a paper from the 2021 ACL Conference. The paper is *Conversations Are Not Flat: Modeling the Dynamic Information Flow across Dialogue Utterances*.

You can the paper [here](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.11/).

You can see the summary document [here](https://github.com/platformer/NLP/blob/main/HW10/ACL_Paper_Summary.pdf).
